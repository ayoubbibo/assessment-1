# Lizard Global React Developer Assessment

# HAKEMI AYOUB
I am hakemi ayoub 4th year enginrering student at POLYTECH Montpellier (FRANCE).

I created the assessment app in React witch display some posts that are Retrieved from an Api.
For the style I used bootstrap and css.
I tried to accumplish all the requirements:
1. Retrieve the data from the mock API.
2. Output the data in a list, including properties from the data that are appropriate for a list view.
3. Implement a category filter - this can be single or multi-select.
4. Implement pagination - this can be traditional numbered pages or "load more".
5. Use semantic markup where possible.
6. Create a responsive layout with HTML and CSS.
And
7. Use client-side routing to create a "detail" page.
8. Persist filter state in the query string.

I tried to (1. Include animated transitions between application state, e.g. when filtering)
but when i was faced to some problems during the installation of the framer-motion library
witch help so much to handle the animated transition between application state but unfortunately
I did not had the chance to find a solution.
